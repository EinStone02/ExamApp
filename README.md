# Project Report: Mobile Exam Application

## Project Scenario

The objective of this project was to develop a mobile application that allows teachers to create, edit, and manage exams and enables students to take these exams. The app was developed in response to the need for more flexible and accessible educational tools, especially considering the increased use of e-learning platforms in educational institutions. This entire project was designed, implemented, and managed by Mert Tektas, demonstrating my comprehensive skills in handling all aspects of software development from conception to deployment.

## Project Features

- **Teacher Dashboard**: Teachers can log in to create, edit, and delete exams. They can also view the results of completed exams.
- **Student Interface**: Students can log in to view available exams and take them. After completing an exam, they receive immediate feedback on their performance.
- **Login Functionality**: Distinguishes between teacher and student access with different permissions.
  - **Teacher Login**: Username: `admin`, Password: `admin`
  - **Student Login**: Username: `student`, Password: `student`

## Interface Design

The user interface is designed to be simple and user-friendly to facilitate easy navigation. It employs a clear color scheme that maximizes readability and ensures contrast across different devices. All interactive elements are designed to be easily accessible and operable.

## Programming

The app was developed in Java using the Android Studio IDE. Basic functionalities were implemented for user authentication, which controls access to different features of the app based on user type (teacher or student). Data is stored and verified locally to ensure functionality even without a constant internet connection.

## Testing

Testing of the app was conducted on a virtual Android device through the Android Studio emulator. Additional tests were performed on multiple physical devices to ensure the app's compatibility and performance. Testing included verifying the functionality of all features, the usability of the interface elements, and performance stability under various conditions.

## Resources

The following resources were utilized for development:
- **Android Studio**: For all development and debugging of the app.
- **Java Development Kit**: As the primary programming language for backend logic.
- **Google Material Design**: For design guidelines and interface elements.

## Conclusion

The app demonstrates potential to enhance the educational process by providing a flexible, accessible tool for exam preparation and execution. Future updates could include cloud integration for data storage and advanced analytics features for teachers. This project was a solo endeavor by Mert Tektas, underscoring my capabilities in full-stack development, from database management to front-end design.
